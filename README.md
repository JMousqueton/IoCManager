## 📖 Usage

### Creating an IOC

1. Navigate to **Add IOC** from the menu
2. Select IOC type (IPv4, Domain, Hash, etc.)
3. Enter the IOC value
4. Set severity, confidence, and TLP level
5. Add description and tags
6. Choose a **Lifecycle Status**: *To be reviewed* (default), *Active*, or *Draft*
7. Click **Create IOC**

> IOCs created as **To be reviewed** are immediately placed in the approval queue and reviewers are notified.

### Enriching IOCs

Click the **Enrich IOC** button on any IOC detail page to:
- Fetch VirusTotal analysis for hashes and URLs
- Get URLScan.io screenshots for URLs
- Lookup GeoIP data for IP addresses
- Retrieve ASN information

### Creating Relationships

Link related IOCs together:
1. Open an IOC detail page
2. Click **Add Relationship** in the Related IOCs section
3. Search for target IOC
4. Select relationship type (resolves_to, contains, etc.)
5. Add optional notes

### Generating YARA Rules

1. Open any hash-based IOC
2. Click **Generate YARA**
3. Toggle between YARA and YARA-X syntax
4. Copy or download the rule

### Commenting

Add comments to IOCs for collaboration:
- Use **Markdown** formatting for rich text
- **@mention** users to notify them
- **Reply** to create threaded discussions
- **Edit/Delete** your own comments

### IOC Lifecycle Management

IOCs follow a structured approval workflow to ensure quality and accountability.

#### States

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Draft** | Work in progress — only the creator and admins can see and edit it |
| **In Review** | Submitted for approval — reviewers are notified and can approve or reject |
| **Active** | Approved and operational — visible to all users |
| **Archived** | Retired — kept for historical reference, no longer active |

#### Workflow

```
Draft ──→ In Review ──→ Active ──→ Archived
            │                         ↑
            └─── (rejected) ──→ Draft   └─── Restore
```

#### For IOC Creators

1. Create an IOC — it defaults to **In Review** and reviewers are notified automatically
2. Alternatively, save as **Draft** to continue editing before submitting
3. On a Draft IOC, click **Submit for Review** when ready
4. Once approved, the IOC becomes **Active**
5. If rejected, the IOC returns to **Draft** with a rejection reason you can address

#### For Reviewers / Admins

1. A badge in the navbar shows the number of IOCs pending review
2. Navigate to **Approvals** in the top menu to see the full queue
3. On any IOC in review, click **Approve** to make it active or **Reject** with a reason
4. Reviewers can also **Archive** active IOCs and **Restore** archived ones

#### Marking for Review (quick path)

On any **Active** IOC detail page:
1. Toggle the **"To be reviewed"** switch
2. The lifecycle status automatically moves to **In Review** and reviewers are notified
3. Toggling it off restores the status to **Active**

#### Reviewer Role

The reviewer flag is independent of the user's role and can be granted to any user:
1. Navigate to **Admin → Reviewers**
2. Click **Grant** next to any user to give them reviewer privileges
3. Click **Revoke** to remove reviewer access

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Enhance account security with optional TOTP-based two-factor authentication:

**Enabling MFA**:
1. Navigate to your profile page
2. Click **"Enable MFA"** in the Multi-Factor Authentication section
3. Scan the QR code with your authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy, Microsoft Authenticator)
4. Enter the 6-digit verification code to confirm setup
5. Save your 10 backup codes in a secure location (each can only be used once)

**Logging in with MFA**:
1. Enter your username and password as usual
2. You'll be redirected to an MFA verification page
3. Enter the 6-digit code from your authenticator app
4. Alternatively, check "Use a backup code instead" and enter one of your backup codes

**Managing MFA**:
- **View Backup Codes**: See how many backup codes you have remaining
- **Regenerate Codes**: Generate new backup codes if you've used most of them (requires MFA verification)
- **Disable MFA**: Turn off MFA protection (requires password + current MFA code)

**Security Features**:
- Rate limiting: Maximum 10 failed verification attempts per 15 minutes
- Session timeout: MFA verification must be completed within 5 minutes
- Backup codes: 10 one-time use codes for device loss scenarios
- Audit logging: All MFA events (enable, disable, login attempts) are logged
- Admin visibility: Admins can see which users have MFA enabled

**Note**: MFA is optional and configured per-user. Existing users are not affected when MFA is added to the system.
